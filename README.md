### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- what starts -->
## Things I've learned the hard way
* Wearing multiple hats would be the best thing that can happen to you.
* Always solve potential problems so they don't become active problems.
* Be humble. There is always someone better and smarter.
* Ask for help when needed.
* There are always better ways to do things. You need to settle sometimes.
* Simple solutions are hard to build.
* Always try to find someone to learn from.
* Don't criticize what you can't understand.
* Not knowing something does not make you small.
* Try to take responsibility even when it is not your fault. You might make a few friends along the way.
